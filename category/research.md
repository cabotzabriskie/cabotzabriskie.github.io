### Grade Prediction
The Grade Prediction Project (GPP) was developed as a way of using machine learning to provide
an early warning system to introductory physics courses. Using registrar data and in course variables
we built series of models based on what is known in weeks 1-5 of the introductory physics series.
These models can, with reasonably high accuracy (70%-80% in physics 1, 80%-90% in Physics 2), predict if a student will get less than a B in the course. As most instructors often have to wait for the midterms to have a good idea of which students need help, it
is our belief that with these models interventions can be targeted much earlier and in-danger students 
can get the help they need before it is too late to change their course trajectory.

### Multi-Dimensional Item Response Theory

The Multi-Dimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) projects were developed to uncover the factor structure of the most commonly used conceptual inventories in physics education: the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). MIRT, which fits individual logistic models to each question (or item) represents a novel approach to factor analysis and is especially well suited for instruments not designed with a factor structure in mind. Using MIRT we were able to build highly statistically significant confirmatory models of both the FCI and the CSEM.

You can read the MIRT FCI paper [here](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.010137)
The MIRT CSEM paper is currently under review.
