### Grade Prediction
The Grade Prediction Project (GPP) was developed as a way of using machine learning to provide
an early warning system to introductory physics courses. Using registrar data and in course variables
we built series of models based on what is known in weeks 1-5 of the introductory physics series.
These models can, with reasonably high accuracy, predict if a student will get less than a B in the course.
As most instructors often have to wait for the midterms to have a good idea of which students need help, it
is our belief that with these models interventions can be targeted much earlier and in-danger students 
can get the help they need before it is too late to change their course trajectory.
